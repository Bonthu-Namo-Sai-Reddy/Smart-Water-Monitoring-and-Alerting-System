# Smart-Water-Monitoring-and-Alerting-System
This project monitors the water quality using a TDS sensor. It reads TDS values and transmits the data from an Arduino to an ESP32 Dev Kit via UART. If the TDS value exceeds the threshold value, an alert SMS is sent continuously to a registered mobile number until clean water is supplied.
